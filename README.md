# R Programming for Data Science
## Roger D. Peng

This repository contains the files for the book *R Programming for
Data Science*, as it is built on [bookdown.org](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/) and on
[Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/rprogramming/). This book was originally
published on Leanpub (and still is). The two versions are identical.

Currently, there are three branches:

* `master`: used to store anything that is common between the Leanpub and Bookdown versions of the book

* `bookdown`: used to build the Bookdown version of the book

* `leanpub`: sued to build the Leanpub version of the book


### Before You Start

Before building the book with the bookdown package, you need to 

1. unzip the `book_datasets.zip` file, which contains the datasets referenced in some of the chapters.

2. Install all of the packages listed in the [_R_package_list.txt](https://github.com/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/blob/master/manuscript/_R_package_list.txt) file.
