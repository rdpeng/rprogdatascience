# Stay in Touch!

Thanks for purchasing this book. If you are interested in
hearing more from me about things that I'm working on (books, data
science courses, podcast, etc.), I have a regular podcast called [Not So Standard Deviations](http://nssdeviations.com) that I co-host with Dr. Hilary Parker, a Data Scientist at Stitch Fix. On this podcast, Hilary and I talk about the craft of data science and discuss common issues and problems in analyzing data. We'll also compare how data science is approached in both academia and industry contexts and discuss the latest industry trends.  You can listen to recent episodes on our web page or you can subscribe to it in [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/not-so-standard-deviations/id1040614570) or your favorite podcasting app.

For those of you who purchased a **printed copy** of this book, I encourage you to go to the Leanpub web site and [obtain the e-book version](https://leanpub.com/rprogramming), which is available for free. The reason is that I will occasionally update the book with new material and readers who purchase the e-book version are entitled to free updates (this is unfortunately not yet possible with printed books).

Thanks again for purchasing this book and please do stay in touch!
